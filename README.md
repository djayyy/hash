Aim of the project

Build a SEARCH ENGINE to display file names in
sorted order of the frequency of the word searched.



Procedure

► Read and store all file names of ‘.txt’ format into a vector.
► Read each word from a file one by one from all the files.
► Store the word (independent of its letter case) at the index corresponding to its
hash value in the hash table using linked list to avoid collisions.
A Linked list stores a word and the frequency corresponding to each file
► Corresponding to the hash value of the word that user has input, search the linked
list for the word.
► Display the frequency of word corresponding to each file in a sorted order.
